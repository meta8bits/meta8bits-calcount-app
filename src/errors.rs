//! Allow conversion from [anyhow::Error] to [ServerError], which is the error
//! type returned from all of our route handlers. Since [ServerError]
//! implements [axum::response::IntoResponse], we're able to return
//! [anyhow::Error] right out of our route handlers with this little bit of
//! code; allowing good `?` ergonomics throughout error-generating code paths.
